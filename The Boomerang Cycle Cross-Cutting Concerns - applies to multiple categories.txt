The Boomerang Cycle Cross-Cutting Concerns (applies to multiple categories)

Logging & Audit

Use append-only audit log for financial and admin events.

Retain audit logs per regional compliance rules.

Encryption & Secrets

All PII: encrypted at rest with KMS.

Use HSM/KMS for keys. Rotate keys regularly.

Rate-Limiting & Anti-Abuse

Global rate limits per IP and per user (e.g., max 10 donations/day).

Device and behavioral fingerprinting for fraud detection.

Testing & QA

Unit tests for allocation algorithms.

Integration tests for payment flows and cycle processing (simulate high-volume bursts).

Contract tests for APIs.

Observability

Metrics: number of donors/sec, allocations/sec, queue depth, avg latency.

Tracing for critical flows (donation → tokenization → allocation → payout).

Compliance

KYC/AML: risk-based checks for large cumulative withdrawals or flagged accounts.

Jurisdiction-aware tax and reporting outputs.

Transparency & Governance

Public transparency dashboard exposing non-PII aggregate stats.

Open-source repository with verifiable builds and reproducible audit traces.

Developer Handoff Checklist (for each category)

 Data model (ERD) for donors, donations, cycles, intervals, allocations, premiums, audit logs.

 API spec (OpenAPI) for donation creation, payment webhooks, cycle status, admin endpoints.

 Background job design (queues, retries, dead-letter handling) for allocation & payouts.

 Security design doc (encryption, KMS, IAM, vulnerability scanning).

 Compliance runbook (KYC thresholds, tax form rules by region, data retention policy).

 Test cases for functional flows and edge conditions (failed payments, partial intervals).

 Operations runbook (deployment, rollback, incident triage, runbook links).
